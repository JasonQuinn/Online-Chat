# Online-Chat

A applicate which allows people to chat online in real time using web sockets.

Demo can be seen [here].(http://onlinechat.azurewebsites.net/)
To use click "Create a new chat" and sent the link to a friend or group. You can then talk to each other and recieve updates in the window. 

Log in is currently broken and I havent styled the site yet.
